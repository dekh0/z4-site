        <h1>Tanhx</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>Tanhx – award winning stereo saturator/soft clipper/fattening device.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            From subtle analogue peak limiting and nicely colored crest-factor reduction to creamy harmonics enhancing
            and bluesy tubey overdrive. When using it on a channel 75% you don’t need any “surgical” EQing and peak
            compression after this one. Just great on drums, synths, guitars (very tubey!), just everything!
            <br>
            <br>
            Tanhx soft-clipping/harmonic generation is very dynamic, it reacts differently to fast and slow level
            changes, to incoming sound spectral balance, so it sounds very alive and organic, completely not like a
            basic diode clippers or overdrive pedals.
            <br>
            It is specially designed to add the effects of an old analog console channel in a modern workflows, and make
            it good without occupying lot of space. It is not a clone, it is versatile device which can bring a wide
            palette of colors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tanhx is a stereo device (unbalanced TRS/6.3 jack on I/O).
            <br>
            Powered by USB with any PSU/phone charger or laptop/desktop PC or even a powerbank(!) using basic USB-B
            cable (same you use for MIDI-keyboards).

            <h3>Sound character</h3>
            <p>
                It is not a secret, that excellent audio interface excels a good ones mainly in analogue
                circuits.
                There are too much compromises made in mid-priced soundcards: cheap, bad sounding opamps, cheap
                caps
                of small values and low operating temperature limits, and so on.
                Definitely, any AD-DA interface will benefit from good de- signed discrete-based preamp, for
                example, but this is completely different topic. We'll limit our mission to changing bad
                sounding
                opamps to good or clean sound- ing ones — you should choose them depending on your own taste,
                and
                changing electrolytic caps for more ap- propriate ones.

                We were asked for this instruction for pretty long time, and every time someone asked us we
                wrote
                complete explanations (but without pics) in private messages. Fi- nally, this manual will be
                available for public access.
                This is not a manual for newbies, nor this is a detailed instructions,
                it is just a roadmap for those who skilled in soldering and can read schematics from the board.
                Think of this instruction as of an example of what you can do, but you can do more!
